XML version
-----------
Specifies the version of the XML standard shown in the XML declaration.

This value is always present if an XML declaration is included in the exported file.

There are two possible values:

- [`1.0`](https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/) - This is the current XML standard and should be used for most cases.
- [`1.1`](https://www.w3.org/TR/2006/REC-xml11-20060816/) - This is a previous standard and should only be used when needed.
