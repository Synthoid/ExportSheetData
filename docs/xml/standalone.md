Standalone
----------
Specifies if the exported XML document relies on information from an external source, such as external [document type definition (DTD)](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_dtd.asp).

If set to `None` the standalone section will not be included in the XML declaration. For most cases, the standalone section can be safely left out of the XML declaration.
