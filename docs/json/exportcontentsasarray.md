Export content as array
-----------------------
Converts exported JSON data from a standalone JSON object to a raw JSON array.

This produces JSON that does not function alone, but can be used in specific situations and workflows.

### Example: ###

**Sheet name: `Items`**

Item | Cost | Description
---- | ---- | -----------
Wooden Sword | 2 | A simple wooden sword. Guess you could hit people with it.
Iron Sword | 5 | A dull iron sword. More bat than blade honestly.
Diamond Shield | 1000 | Ha! You can only carry 999 monies!
Health Potion | 3 | Restores some health.

*Default Output:*
```json
{
  "Items": {
    "Wooden Sword": {
      "Item": "Wooden Sword",
      "Cost": 2,
      "Description": "A simple wooden sword. Guess you could hit people with it."
